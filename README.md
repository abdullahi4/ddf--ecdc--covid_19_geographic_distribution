# ECDC geographic distributi COVID-19 cases

ECDC's aggregation of world wide reported covid-19 cases, updated daily.

## Data source

All data comes from [ECDC's coronavirus web site](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/coronavirus), specifically the [csv formatted file](https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv) on the [Download todayâ€™s data on the geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) page.

ECDC updates its data daily. We updates this dataset set hourly. Therefore there may be a delay between the ECDC website and our dataset of one hour.
